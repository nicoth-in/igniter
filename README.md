## About Igniter

Igniter is rapid and powerful framework. Major features are:

- It uses the most advance node managing method. All JS objects created as Igniter Elements are native DOM Nodes.
- Igniter based on Custom Elements Registry. It can be mixed with native, cause it **is** native.
- It is reactive. If you change Igniter Element, you actually change DOM.
- No Virtual DOM by default, no abstractions.
- You can use templates, mix generated HTML with JS without pain.
